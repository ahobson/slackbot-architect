# slackbot-architect

A slackbot using the architect framework

This bot accepts slack DMs and then sends that message back to a
channel using a webhook. The idea is that the bot might accept a
command with private information, do a thing, and then report to the
world the status of processing the thing.

Done first with the serverless framework at
